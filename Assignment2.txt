**1. Classification Empirical Study**

The goal of this study is to develop classifiers and document the analysis of the results. Two classification algorithm will be explored: Naive
Bayes and Logistic Regression. These classifiers will be trained on real data and be evaluated on their predictions.

The dataset we have chosen for this assignment is the data collected from a study conducted on maternal health risk. It has collected data on
various paitents like Age, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Body Temperature, Heart Rate and Risk Level. These 
have been collected to better understand how the different factors affect the maternal mortality.

This dataset contains six features and the target of the classifiers would be to predict the risk level. The features are the attributes mentioned
above. The risk level can be one of these three: high, medium,and low. Therefore, it has three classes. This dataset has no missing values.
