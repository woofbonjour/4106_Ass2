**1. Classification Empirical Study**

The goal of this study is to develop classifiers and document the analysis of the results. Two classification algorithm will be explored: Naive
Bayes and Logistic Regression. These classifiers will be trained on real data and be evaluated on their predictions.

The dataset we have chosen for this assignment is the data collected from a study conducted on maternal health risk. It has collected data on
various paitents like Age, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Body Temperature, Heart Rate and Risk Level. These 
have been collected to better understand how the different factors affect the maternal mortality.

This dataset contains six features and the target of the classifiers would be to predict the risk level. The features are the attributes mentioned
above. The risk level can be one of these three: high, medium, and low. Therefore, it has three classes. This dataset has no missing values.

**2. Feature Engineering**

The dataset has six attributes that are used to determine the risk level of the patient. There is no missing data. We do not have the medical expertise or background to determine if all of the six features affect the risk level.

Some ways to figure out if there are attributes that have no impact on the risk level:
1. Consult with medical professionals or domain experts.
2. Create a scatter plot with all the values to see a visual represntation of patterns and association of the attributes.
3. Carry out correlation analysis of each attribute or use different statistical tests to analyze the attributes..
4. Try different combinations of attributes to see how they affect the risk level.

Since the dataset is taken from a published study conducted by a professional in the field, we will conduct our study with the assumption that all attibutes are equally important. 

All of the attrbiutes are continuous features. Below lists the ranges of each based on the dataset:
- Age ranges from 10-70
- SystolicBP ranges from 70-160
- DiastolicBP ranges from 49-100
- Blood Sugar ranges from 6.0-19.0
- Body Temp ranges from 98-103
- Heart rate ranges from 7-90

Normalization of attributes often help improve performances of the algorithms. However, that is only the case when the ranges present are varied. The ranges of each attribute in this case is close to each other and there is no indication that normalizing them would have an impact on the performance. In fact, if we were to normalize, it might have the opposite effect. It could decrease the significance of the result. Therefore, we will not be normalizing the attributes.

**Dataset**

The dataset is a CSV file with 1013 entries. Each entry in the dataset is an input given to the algorithm to train and test it. It consists of seven elements:
1. An integer corresponding to the age.
2. An integer corresponding to the SystolicBP.
3. An integer corresponding to the DiastolicBP.
4. A float corresponding to the Blood Suger (BS).
5. An integer corresponding to the BodyTemp.
6. An integer corresponding to the HeartRate.
7. The expected risk level is based on the six previous attributes.


3. Encoding Features

As you will use models that need discrete or continuous attributes, think about data encoding and transformation.

Logistic regression:

This classifier expects continuous attributes. Since all of our attributes are continuous, there is no need to carry out encoding or transformation techniques.

Naive Bayes:

This classifier expects discrete attributes. CategoricalNB and GaussianNB are two of several classifiers in scikitlearn. CategoricalNB expects discrete attributes whereas GaussianNB expects continuous attributes. The attributes need to be transformed/discretized in order to use CategoricalNB. There would be no need for transformation when using GaussianNB.
